              <p>
                I grew up with this stereotype all around me. But the more I looked at other factors
                &mdash; at unequal policing, criminalization based on racial prevalence, unreported and
                intracommunity crime &mdash; the more I've grown convinced there are many things wrong
                that the simple numbers don't take into account.

              <p>
                So I've created this interactive chart below to see in what ways we can <em>tweak</em>
                our statistics and see what difference that makes. Disclaimers are two sections down, but

              <p>
                As with any project involving statistics, I run the risk of conveying not sufficiently
                justified assertions, misleading impressions, and blatantly lying. So for each of the
                ways that I "scale", I've included tooltips indicating what data I'm basing
                changes on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even then, combining multiple statistics (which are already approximations) greatly increases
                errors and confidence intervals. So I've actually also been rather conservative with
                the numbers, favoring rounding down and taking the lower of statistical ranges to be safe.
                So hopefully, that means these graphs at least will underclaim differences from the
                official numbers, not overclaim.
              </p>
              <p>
                But hey, do still even then be sure to keep in mind that these are manipulations,
                not official facts.

              In its most recent publication, the US Census reports that over twice as many Blacks (26.2%)
              are in poverty as Asians (12.0%) or Whites (10.1%). Furthermore, it's been reported that,
              generally speaking, impoverished individuals are twice as likely to be arrested, and up to
              four times for impoverished youth.
            </p>
            <p>
              This only speaks to arrest rate. Policing tends to be heavier in poorer areas. Crime in
              poorer areas is also more conspicuous. In fact, evidence generally points that the impact
              of affluent, white-collared crime tends to have a much greater overall impact (e.g. monetary amount, people impacted).
            </p>
            <p>
              So, this scale is meant to takes out the some of the factor in terms of different
              income levels between different races (e.g. treats the impoverished portion of these statistics
              as if they weren't).

              This statistic doesn't do any sophisticated computation on say sentencing by crime
              by race, but do keep in mind that there isn't any evidence to suggest that blacks
              commit <em>worse</em> crimes than other races. In fact, it's worth thinking about what
              we consider to be the <em>worst</em> crimes anyway -- white collar crime generally involves
              many more people impacted broadly and much more money than say petty theft.

              I want to add some caution to this statistic. It's clear from the numbers and intuition that the most crime
              <em>is</em> committed by Whites by sheer ratio in America. But it also seems that a Black person
              has a higher chance of being a criminal than other races.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, be sure to untangle the two concepts of being criminal and being arrested &mdash; think
              of the other factors I'm trying to argue make this arrest number and actual criminal activity
              (whatever that means) not super accurate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, and more importantly, many people may justify their stereotyping of Blacks
              as criminal from this population scaling. But consider from your individual perspective: you're
              statistically much more likely to be a victim of white perpetrator than of a black one by,
              again, sheer numbers.

            <p>
              This one didn't turn out the way I expected. First, let's get some stats. Supposedly, 88% of white
              collar crime goes unreported to the criminal justice system &mdash; people turn much more to their own
              financial institutions instead. So I took the parts of the crime statistics that are considered
              white collar crime (forgery, fraud, embezzlement, stolen property) and upped those by 88% for each
              race. Turns out a higher portion of black crimes (relative to all crime reported here, not just
              to black vs. white arrests) is for these categories.
            </p>
            <p>
              This does, of course, discount the role of affluence. But I think something that might be worth
              noting here is that this affluence statistic might be less relevant for changing the actual
              ratios of crime among races, but more relevant toward the impacts of the crimes on the rest of
              people. For example, it's become a common saying to refer to the bankers on Wall Street as criminals.
              But in that case, which of the banks' employees  are we referring to? In a lot of cases,
              we're thinking about the very elite (not to discount anything about everyone below that),
              which is a very small number, with a disproportionately large impact. That sort of impact
              measurement would be very hard to create though.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another fun statistic: white collar crime is thought to cause more monetary damages total
              than <em>every other crime category combined.</em> Whoa.

              In general, crime is mostly intraracial (for the ones that make sense, e.g. not drug use),
              especially murder. However, crime is reported at a much different rate between races.
              So even accepting the FBI's currently definitions of crime, the <em>actual</em> amounts
              committed will not be exactly proportional to the reported statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's worth noting that Asians have an exceptionally low reporting rate and it seems somewhat
              intuitive to agree that domestic or intracommunity violence or crime is reported less.
              This argument likely also extends to more affluent white communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Specifically in the case of rape, Asians report at an extremely low 16%, about half that
              of whites and blacks. And in the case of rape, it's extremely well known that most rape
              happens by people the victim knows. Alas, there aren't really great statistics on rape victims
              and so I can't really create a good scale for that.
